## Summary
Using physical vectors, sometimes a location can be detected by its features. Other times, finding the source of the original image is just as important.

Got it, thanks. We were right; breached in a few online dumps; trust Zuck to have "I_hate_myspace_tom" as his password. Long story short, we can link this to the breach. Problem is, we're unsure exactly which global node server the roomba's are going to target.

We did however find this image on the server, as the most recently changed file. It could be a geo-map of where they're planning to strike next, or it could simply be the ex-admin's next holiday destination. Either way, we need to know where that is NOW to start targeted keyword analysis. There's no metadata on this one - you're going to have to recognise the physical features.

Find the source of the image online, and I'll take care of the rest.

NOTE: This challenge is marked *manually*. It will state "incorrect", please ignore. PLEASE CONTACT A MOD WITH SCREENSHOT EVIDENCE WITH YOUR SUBMISSION.

## Solution
Search all rollercoasters (yes, you probably tried bridges and sprinklers too!) until you find one that is similar, in the area of Houston, San Antonio or Austin.  Can chop up video frame by frame to identify their general charastersitcs. Then assess design and street view attributes, before looking at folioge, street signs and lightpoles to line up the distance with the video. Once this is done, identify your location and note that if is the particular street as TEXAS 151 Access Road.

### Long Version:
One of the videos has her singing in the car and a rollercoaster in the background, it was the San Antonio Sea World rollercoaster.

Yeah I thought it was a bridge but inverted the colors and saw the zigzag in the middle. Went thru all bridges and rollercoasters in TX but noticed from a google search it looked similar at Sea World.

We can tell from this image in the video the vehicle is travelling on Access 151 Rd, San Antonio Texas.

1. The SeaWorld rollercoaster is in the background of the video. It has the same number of rungs and central platform zig-zag steps as in the video.
2. There is a stop sign in the location which is also appears in the video.
3. There is a sign for "inline retail & pad sites" in the video which is also at the location on that road.

4. The same lightpoles exist in the video as with the geographical reference.
