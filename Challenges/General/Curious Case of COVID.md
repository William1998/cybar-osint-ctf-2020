## Summary
Connect physical attributes that are moving/blurry with real locations in the wild. Use directional and navigational skills to orient oneself into the position of the vehicle, and then identify y our position.

## Description
We've received a report that a roomba has been detected travelling through Texas, USA. All we know is that they're likely between Houston, San Antonio or Austin. Which one, we don't know.

All we have is a video taken from inside the moving vehicle. You need to piece together the sourroundings to give us the exact road name they were travelling on.

Here is the recorded video: https://mega.nz/folder/E1lXzZYa#lZawGxAgr57-IKJPR8znhQ

For example, 16 Maple street would be: {16 Maple}

Flag format: `CYBAR{x x}`

## Solution
Search all rollercoasters (yes, you probably tried bridges and sprinklers too!) until you find one that is similar, in the area of Houston, San Antonio or Austin.  Can chop up video frame by frame to identify their general charastersitcs. Then assess design and street view attributes, before looking at folioge, street signs and lightpoles to line up the distance with the video. Once this is done, identify your location and note that if is the particular street as TEXAS 151 Access Road.

### Long Version:
One of the videos has her singing in the car and a rollercoaster in the background, it was the San Antonio Sea World rollercoaster.

Yeah I thought it was a bridge but inverted the colors and saw the zigzag in the middle. Went thru all bridges and rollercoasters in TX but noticed from a google search it looked similar at Sea World.

We can tell from this image in the video the vehicle is travelling on Access 151 Rd, San Antonio Texas.

1. The SeaWorld rollercoaster is in the background of the video. It has the same number of rungs and central platform zig-zag steps as in the video.
2. There is a stop sign in the location which is also appears in the video.
3. There is a sign for "inline retail & pad sites" in the video which is also at the location on that road.

4. The same lightpoles exist in the video as with the geographical reference.
