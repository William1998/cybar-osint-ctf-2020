## Summary
Public city databases can include detailed information about buildings.

## Description
We need more information on the building to work out the level it's being potentially filmed from. How many levels (above ground) does the building have?

Flag format: `CYBAR{x}`

## Solution
By searching for "melbourne city/building databases" they can find the data.melbourne.vic.gov.au database containing this information. Other architectural and real estate sites also reveal this.

Alternatively, they can try use guides or eye-witness accounts of the buildings levels - these can get interesting due to 'underground basements' and 'pools' counting as floor levels. If cross referenced with enough sources, the flag can be found. Two flags included for counting basements and not.
