## Summary
Posting comments or pictures about your local area, shops or community could pinpoint your location.

## Description
We've learned that Pong has a vehicle and may have visited nearby towns in the past few months. We were going to do license plate detection but no doubt the Roomba's have either changed this or prevented plate reads. We need to know the exact make and model car Pong is driving to get visual confirmation.

Find the make and model of Pong's vehicle.

Flag format: `CYBAR{x x}`

## Solution
View Pong's conversation/post about getting a speeding ticket and look up the registration details for the vehicle. Use a tool such as: https://www.service.transport.qld.gov.au/checkrego/public/Welcome.xhtml to find this.
