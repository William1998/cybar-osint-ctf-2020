Challenge text:
Alright, we need to start building up a profile of Marc's friend, Alycee. Find anything you can that might help us find more information on government databases about her such as an Australian Business Number (ABN).

We managed to locate her tax agent on AirTasker - maybe you could get in touch and somehow convince him to provide some information about her tax return.

Public records show his email address is taxteamtechs@gmail.com

Flag format: `CYBAR{x x x}`

## Solution
Reach out to Paul requesting information on his clients using the email address on his Airtasker profile page. He sends a 'public' copy that has the ABN.
