## Description
Let's start canvassing Marc's working life. Which town is Marc's primary (not newest) workplace located in?

Flag format: `CYBAR{x}`

## Solution
View Marc's twitter account, where he mentions train/bus delays on his line, between two towns. Figure out which direction he's going and he mentions that it is a workplace. Using this, you can figure out where he's going.
