## Summary
Posting photos and reference to art, including a username on a twitter profile could lead to enumerating additional accounts.

## Description
It's suspected the Roomba targeted one of Marc's friends, Alycee, with COVID19 based on her regular flights around the world to different critical infrastructure areas (e.g. gas and oil). We must undertake contact tracing for Alycee without warning the subject. We need to find out every location she has been in the past few years to get a profile. This profile will then help us predict and prevent where she might go next.

What is the full URL of Alycee's art account?

Flag format: `CYBAR{https://www.x.x/x}`

## Solution
Search for her handle/username as shown in the 'location' on her profile in popular art upload accounts. Once DeviantArt is found, the URL is submitted. #DA gives away that art and DA.
