## Description
We need more locations Alycee may have or will visit in the future.

What is the exact volcano that Alycee visited?

## Solution
Use the dates in the picture as well as the magma to find that April 30th, 2018 there was an eruption of the Pu'u 'O'o crater on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano. Pictures of that eruption available online looks similar to the drawing with a volcano and the mention of "HAWAII".
