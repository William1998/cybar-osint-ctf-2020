## Summary
A home-made video reveals in which building the subject lives.

## Description
Contact Tracing continues. We need to locate Marc's home and evacuate the neighborhood/building and place them in isolation.

What's the name of the building Marc lives in?

Flag format: `CYBAR{x}`

## Solution
On Marc Hevis Twitter profile there is a video about pollution and not being able to go onto their balcony. By observing landmarks, a building with a face (Barak Building) can be located. 

Further analysis and geographical reference results in a few skyscrapers. These can be reduced by figuring out which are residential, and the angle and height taken from. 

Other buildings such as the Melbourne Gaol and RMIT buildings can also be seen in the foreground, providing depth perception.
